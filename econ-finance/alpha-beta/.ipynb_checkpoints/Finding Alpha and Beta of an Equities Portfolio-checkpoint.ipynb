    "# Finding Alpha and Beta of Stock Prices\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn how to compute for the alpha and beta of PSE listed stocks relative to the PSEi.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are alpha and beta?\n",
    "In finance and investment, alpha $\\alpha$ and beta $\\beta$ are indicators used to analyze and, to an extent, predict returns. Specifically, alpha is the measure of the performance of a stock against an index benchmark at a specific point in time. Beta is the measure of the volatility of the stock relative to an index benchmark.\n",
